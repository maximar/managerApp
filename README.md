### Code Review
#### Readability
In the code variable and method names were made as descriptive as possible based on the logic. And the organization and corresponding tabs were maintained for better understanding.

#### Single Responsibility
Each method was maintained to have a single functionality to perform or evaluate. And each class maintained a single responsibility.

#### DRY Principle
In the UserValidator class, the methods can be improved to make it more abstract.

#### SOLID Principles
Most SOLID principles are respected in the refactored code

#### Error Handling
Validations exist to handle errors but exceptions are not explicitly handled

#### Testing
There are tests covering core validations and save user and search user functionality.
There was no testing for authentication.

#### Documentation
There is little documentation in the code.


### Changes Made during the review.
